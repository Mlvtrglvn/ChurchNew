        <div class="newsheader">Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament</div>
        <div class="newsitem">
            Our monthly Adoration will be held on Sunday, November 22 nd , at 3 pm.
            We will pray for our good preparation of the Jubilee of Mercy. It will be
            followed by a short Biblical catechesis on the meaning of the jubilee year
            in the Old Testament. Everyone is welcome to attend.
        </div>

        <div class="newsheader">Sunday School</div>
        <div class="newsitem">
            Catechesis for children and young people will begin in October. Pre-Communion, post-Communion (as
            preparation for the renewal of the Profession of Faith), pre-Confirmation, and post-Confirmation (on
            Catholic ethics and moral values) classes are being organized. Please register outside the church.
        </div>

        <div class="newsheader">Coffee Morning</div>
        <div class="newsitem">Coffee morning after 10:30 Mass each week, and on the first Sunday of the month after 8:30
            Mass, provide a chance for parishioners to get to know each other and share fellowship. If you enjoy these
            occasions, please take a turn to provide and serve snacks and drinks. Sign up sheets are on the bulletin
            board. Thank you!
        </div>

        <div class="newsheader">Advent Action: Caritas-Nepal</div>
        <div class="newsitem">Each winter, in honor of our patron saint, the St. Vincent’s community
            raises funds from the beginning of Advent through Chinese New Year for
            a charity that serves the very poor or marginalized. This year we will
            support the earthquake relief and community rebuilding organized by
            Caritas—Nepal. More information about the charity and the progress of
            Advent Action will be available on the bulletin board. Anyone interested
            in helping is very welcome—please speak to any member of the pastoral
            team or church council to offer ideas or time. Your generosity allows us
            each year to share some of the joy of the Advent, Christmas and New
            Year seasons with those less fortunate.
            To begin this year’s Advent Action:
            <ul>
                <li>Bake Sale: On Sunday, November 29 th , at St. Vincent’s we will
                    have a Bake Sale and a chance to “Guess the Weight” of a
                    homemade Christmas fruitcake after both Masses. Closest guess
                    wins the cake! Donations of food to sell are very much needed; you
                    can drop them off before Mass at the tables outside. Please speak
                    to Marie Hendricks or Lani Nasayao if you have questions.
                </li>
                <li>Toy Sale: There will be a sale of new toys next Saturday evening
                    and Sunday (November 28 th and 29 th ) until 1 pm at our parish
                    church of St. Andrew in Hang Hau. Please stop by!
