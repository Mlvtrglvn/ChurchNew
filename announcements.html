        On Corpus Christi (June 22) the rite of the Institution of Extraordinary Ministers of the Holy Sacrament will be
        held at 10:30 Mass. After both Masses, there will be a short procession with the Holy Sacrament. Children, and
        especially those who received First Holy Communion last year or will receive it this year, are invited to join
        the Procession; they are encouraged to wear white clothing and to bring baskets of flower petals and leaves to
        scatter during the procession. Members of the choirs and Legion of Mary are also invited to wear their uniforms.

    <div class="newsheader"> Coffee Morning</div>
    <div class="newsitem">
        Sharing snacks and drinks after Mass helps build the St. Vincent’s community and is one of the small ways we
        serve other community members. To run it continuously relies on your support and contributions of food and
        labour.
        <ul>
            <li><b> 8:30 Mass </b>: Due to the shortage of participating families to run coffee morning, in the summer,
                it will
                be suspended at 8:30 Mass until September. Anyone who would be interested in helping out in the fall,
                please
                contact Edith To.
            </li>
            <li><b>10:30 Mass</b>: Volunteers are very much needed; if you enjoy this tradition, please consider
                taking a turn. Information and a sign up sheet are posted on the bulletin board; or speak Lani Nasayao.
