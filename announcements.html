            raises funds from the beginning of Advent through Chinese New Year for
            a charity that serves the very poor or marginalized. This year we will
            support the earthquake relief and community rebuilding organized by
            Caritas—Nepal. More information about the charity and the progress of
            Advent Action will be available on the bulletin board. Anyone interested
            in helping is very welcome—please speak to any member of the pastoral
            team or church council to offer ideas or time. Your generosity allows us
            each year to share some of the joy of the Advent, Christmas and New
            Year seasons with those less fortunate.
