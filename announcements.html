        <div class="newsheader"> Saturday Anticipated Mass</div>
        <div class="newsitem">
            A three-month trial of a Saturday evening anticipated Mass will begin at St. Vincent’s
            on November 8th. In consultation with the church council, the time for Saturday Mass
            has been set at 5:30 pm.
        </div>

        <div class="newsheader">Music festival</div>
        <div class="newsitem">
            Thank you very much to all those who made last Sunday’s Music Festival
            a joyful occasion, by organizing the event, sharing your talents, donating
            food—the bake sales raised over $2000 towards Huiling—or being an
            appreciative audience.
        </div>

        <div class="newsheader">Jumble Sale</div>
        <div class="newsitem">
            On Sunday, 8 February, we will have a jumble sale after both 8:30 and
            10:30 Masses downstairs in the church hall to raise funds for Huiling. If
            you can donate items—clothes, toys, books, appliances—please contact
            Marie Hendricks by email <a href="mailto:Chiliqueen58@gmail.com">Chiliqueen58@gmail.com</a> or phone (9033
            2527); or bring them to Mass.
        </div>

        <div class="newsheader">World Day of the Sick</div>
        <div class="newsitem">The twenty-third World Day of the Sick, and the commemorative feast of
            Our Lady of Lourdes, falls on February 11th. In this context, at the
            anticipated and Sunday Masses next week we will pray for all who are
            burdened by illness, as well as for all professionals and volunteers in the
            field of health care.
            This year’s theme invites us to reflect on a phrase from the Book of Job:
            “I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame” (Job 29:15). If any
            parishioner who is ill wishes to receive the Anointing of the Sick or other
            sacraments please inform Fr. George or Sr. Teresa.
        </div>

        <div class="newsheader">Confirmation</div>
        <div class="newsitem">Confirmation classes will begin on February 22, the first Sunday of Lent. If you
            would like to be confirmed, please speak with Fr. George.
        </div>

        <div class="newsheader">Flowers</div>
        <div class="newsitem">Volunteers are very much needed to help with flowers; you can be
            reimbursed up to $400 if you provide a receipt. Please sign up on the list
            posted on the small bulletin board at the back of the church.
