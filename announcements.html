            If you have luggage or other personal items stored in the church hall or school, please remove them before

            school, and we cannot guarantee the safety of items. Temporary storage of personal belongings on church
            premises will not be permitted after Pentecost. Thank you for your cooperation.

            bulletin board at the back of the church. <br/>
