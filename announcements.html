    <div class="newsitem">
        Sharing snacks and drinks after Mass helps build the St. Vincent’s community and is one of the small ways we
        serve other community members. To run it continuously relies on your support and contributions of food and
        labour.
        <ul>
            <li><b> 8:30 Mass </b>: Due to the shortage of participating families to run coffee morning, in the summer,
                it will
                be suspended at 8:30 Mass until September. Anyone who would be interested in helping out in the fall,
                please
                contact Edith To.
            </li>
            <li><b>10:30 Mass</b>: Volunteers are very much needed; if you enjoy this tradition, please consider
                taking a turn. Information and a sign up sheet are posted on the bulletin board; or speak Lani Nasayao.
