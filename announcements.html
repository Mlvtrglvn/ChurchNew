        <div class="newsitem">
            The theme of this year’s diocesan Lenten campaign from Ash Wednesday to Easter is “Faith comes to perfection
            with love”. Each week will also have a sub-theme to encourage us to participate through prayer, reflection
            and sacrifice.
        </div>

        <div class="newsheader">Stations of the Cross</div>
        <div class="newsitem">
            The Way of the Cross will be prayed at St. Vincent’s each Friday in Lent at 8 pm, beginning this coming
            Friday, March 7. A plenary indulgence is granted for those who piously complete this devotion. Confessions
            will also be heard before and after the meditation.
        </div>

        <div class="newsitem">
            The schedule for Masses and other events for Holy Week is posted at the back of the church; leaflets are
            also available. It will be posted online soon.
