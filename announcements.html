            dispensed from fast and abstinence on that day, but are obliged to choose
            some other suitable penance or works of charity, in keeping with the
            penitential spirit of the season of Lent.
            The rite of the giving of ashes will also be held at 8 pm on Friday,
            February 27th, during the Way of the Cross. In accordance with liturgical
            tradition and diocesan direction, this rite should not be held on a Sunday.
